## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Along the way of doing this project, I learnt a bit more about other CSS selectors that I implemented in setting the font-weight of all the span elements, except for one as shown in the CSS snippet below.

```css
span:not(.small-description){
    font-weight: 600;
}
```

### Continued development

With this project, I challenged myself to use the px measurement as less as possible, but to instead use relative units for margin, padding, font-size, etc. Rem and em were measurements I had not fully grasped before but I now have a better understanding of their usage. I will continue to try to use relative units more than absolute units whenever appropiate in future projects and challenges.
